## 🎯 Key Policy Points

### Caution Fee (50% Rule)
```
If rental = ₦10,000
Then caution fee = ₦5,000 (50%)
Total upfront = ₦15,000
If returned on-time & undamaged: ₦5,000 refund
Net cost to customer: ₦10,000 ✅
```

### Late Return Penalties
```
Per each day late:
├─ Lose 1/3 of caution fee
└─ Pay full daily rental charge again

Example (1 day late, ₦10,000/day rental):
├─ Lose: ₦3,334 from caution fee
├─ Pay: ₦10,000 additional rental
└─ Total owed: ₦13,334 instead of getting ₦5,000 back!
```

### Pick-up & Return Schedule
```
