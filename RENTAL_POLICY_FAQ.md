## Pricing & Payment Questions

### Q: What is a caution fee?
**A:** A caution fee is a security deposit that's 50% of your rental charge. It ensures you return items in good condition and on time. You get it back after returning your items!

### Q: When do I pay the caution fee?
**A:** You pay the caution fee upfront when you pick up the costume. Total payment = Rental charge + Caution fee (50%).

**Example:**
- Rental: ₦10,000
- Caution: ₦5,000 (50%)
- **Total to pay at pick-up: ₦15,000**

### Q: When do I get my caution fee back?
**A:** Your caution fee is refunded at 6pm on the same day you return the items (if returned on time and in good condition). No delays allowed—it must be before 5pm!

### Q: What if I return items late?
**A:** Caution fee refunds are reduced by 1/3 for each day delayed, PLUS you pay additional rental charges for the extra days.

**Example:**
- 1 day late: Lose ₦1,667 from caution fee + Pay ₦10,000 extra rental
- 2 days late: Lose ₦3,334 from caution fee + Pay ₦20,000 extra rental

### Q: Can I get my caution fee back if items are damaged?
**A:** Yes, but the amount depends on the damage level:
- **Minor damage (10-25%)**: Lose ₦500-₦1,250
- **Major damage (50-75%)**: Lose ₦2,500-₦3,750
- **Irreparable**: Lose full caution fee (₦5,000)
