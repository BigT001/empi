## 💡 Key Policy Points

### The "50% Rule"
- Customers pay 50% of rental as caution fee upfront
- This protects EMPI from damage/theft
- Customers get it back if items returned on-time & undamaged
- Fair to both parties

### The "5pm Deadline"
- All returns must be BEFORE 5pm on return date
- Even 1 minute late = 1 full day late penalty
- Allows time for inspection and 6pm refund processing
- Clear, firm deadline prevents disputes

### The "6pm Refund"
- All refunds processed at 6pm (end of business day)
- After inspection is complete
- Gives time to assess damage
- Same-day payment builds customer trust

### The "1/3 Rule"
- For each day late: lose 1/3 of caution fee
- After 3 days: entire caution fee forfeited
- Plus: daily rental charges for extra days
- Strongly discourages late returns

### The "Lagos Only" Rule
- Rentals limited to Lagos State currently
- Protects inventory and reduces risk
- Expansion planned to other states
- Clear to customers from start

## 📱 Quick Reference for Staff

### When Customer Picks Up
```
1. CHECK: "Have you read our rental policy?"
2. COLLECT: Caution fee (50% of rental)
3. INSPECT: Item together with customer
4. DOCUMENT: Any pre-existing damage
5. RECEIPT: Show:
   - Rental amount
   - Caution fee
   - Total paid
   - Return deadline (5pm)
   - Refund time (6pm)
```

### When Customer Returns
```
1. CHECK TIME: Before or after 5pm?
   - Before 5pm: ✅ Process normally
   - After 5pm: ❌ Late fee applies
2. INSPECT: Condition, completeness, damage
3. ASSESS: Damage level & deduction
4. CALCULATE: Refund amount
5. DOCUMENT: Photos if damage exists
6. INFORM: Tell customer of assessment
7. SCHEDULE: Refund at 6pm
```

### Late Return Calculation
```
EXAMPLE: Rental ₦10,000, Caution ₦5,000

1 Day Late:
Caution deduction = ₦5,000 ÷ 3 = ₦1,667
Late rental = ₦10,000
Total owed = ₦11,667

2 Days Late:
Caution deduction = ₦5,000 ÷ 3 × 2 = ₦3,334
Late rental = ₦10,000 × 2 = ₦20,000
Total owed = ₦23,334

3+ Days Late:
Caution fully forfeited (₦5,000) + Late rental charges
```

## 👥 Staff Talking Points

### "Why a 50% Caution Fee?"
*"The caution fee protects both of us. It ensures items come back safely, and you get it back in full if everything goes well!"*

### "Why 5pm Return Deadline?"
*"5pm is when we inspect items and process refunds at 6pm. If you return after 5pm, we can't inspect and refund same-day."*

### "Why Late Penalties?"
*"Late returns can disrupt our next customer's rental. The penalty encourages on-time returns and compensates us for the disruption."*

### "Why Service Area Limited to Lagos?"
*"Right now we're focused on Lagos. We're planning to expand soon—keep checking back!"*

---

## 📞 Customer Service Responses

### "Why is my caution fee not refunding?"
**A:** "Your caution fee refunds at 6pm after we inspect the items. Could you check back after 6pm? If it's still not processed, please contact us."

### "Why do I lose money for being 1 day late?"
**A:** "Our policy charges 1/3 of the caution fee for each day late. Plus the additional daily rental. This encourages timely returns. Next time, set a reminder for your return date!"

### "Can I negotiate the late fee?"
**A:** "Our late fees are set to treat all customers fairly. However, if you have an emergency, please call us—we can discuss your situation."

### "Why didn't I get a full refund?"
**A:** "We found [describe damage]. This is a [damage level]. Here's your refund: [amount]. We have photos documented if you'd like to see them."
